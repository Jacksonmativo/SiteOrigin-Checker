"""Guidance moved to `docs/EXCEPTION_HANDLING_FIXES.md`.

This module previously contained example patches and illustrative code
fragments. Those examples have been migrated to the `docs/` folder; this
file remains as a small redirect so older imports won't fail during local
editing. It intentionally contains no runtime exception-handling examples
to avoid static-analysis flags.
